Oni Match
=========
Source for the Oni Match minigame. The game was created using the [Oni Engine](https://github.com/SamHellawell/oni) to demonstrate its flexibility and suitability.

Setup
=====
To be able to build the game, you'll need to pull the [Oni Engine](https://github.com/SamHellawell/oni). Get it from GitHub ([https://github.com/SamHellawell/oni/](https://github.com/SamHellawell/oni/)) and copy the contents of src/ into the src/ directory for this repository. Alternatively, you can pull the engine seperately and add it as a classpath into your project.
